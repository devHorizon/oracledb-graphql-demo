GraphQL is a new technology and the community is growing rapidly. 
This is just my journey into GraphQL+OracleDB and is not a definitive guide. 

I highly encourage you to take one of your own! Here are a few good places to start



### GraphQL 

The graphql-community-endorsed guide to GraphQL

Others trying to Connect oracle+graphql on GitHub
*Note: I originally picked this topic for my Dev Talk because I thought it had never been done before. 
While that may have been true at the time it looks like a few others have followed suit!

### Oracle Database

Query Oracle DB 18c in your browser. Learn & share SQL for free.   
https://livesql.oracle.com 

One of the best cloud services I've dealt with (also pays my bills)   
https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/database   

(unrelated to Oracle's DB) Currently I think our best service is   
https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/big-data-cloud   
Because in my opinion it's the most fun :)

### This Site 

Site was made with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static-site generator built with GraphQL and 
a modern JavaScript stack. My Personal Favorite static-site generator is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), 
which I use to build my personal site [https://sblack4.github.io](https://sblack4.github.io)
